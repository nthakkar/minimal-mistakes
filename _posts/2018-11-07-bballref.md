I've been (half-)joking a lot about how [IDM](http://idmod.org) should use its new hardware for sports gambling. That (half-)joke got taken a little further recently: I used [PyQuery](https://pythonhosted.org/pyquery/) to write a webscrapper for [https://www.basketball-reference.com/](https://www.basketball-reference.com/). My fantasy team still sucks this year (seriously, really bad), but this turned into a cool learning experience that's given me some interesting data.

I've wondered about web scraping for a while now. How do you do it? Is it legal ([related](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32429445/is-web-scraping-allowed))? Is it easy? While I'm sure that people at Google do a much more sophistocated job, if you're looking to scrape data from a website with relatively consistent formatting, this set of PyQuery tools could probably be easily adapted.
