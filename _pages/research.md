My research focuses on developing mathematical models for manipulating charge and light at the nanoscale. For a comprehensive list of my publications, take a look at my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Op6vAucAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). On this page, I'll just highlight some projects I've been working on recently.

Microresonators as platforms for nanoscience
--------------------------------------------

I've been working in collaboration with the [Goldsmith group](https://goldsmith.chem.wisc.edu/) at UW Madison on understanding how whispering-gallery-mode-supporting microresonators can be used to make photothermal measurements of the optical properties of nanoscale systems and single molecules. This work has been featured on [C&E News](http://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i45/Whispering-microresonators-detect-absorption-spectra.html?type=paidArticleContent) and [Nature News and Views](http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v10/n12/full/nphoton.2016.237.html). 

For this project, I developed a dynamical systems model of the interaction between plasmonic particles and whispering gallery modes that can be used to statistically infer near-field properties of this hybrid system from my collaborators' experimental data. As we show in a [Nature Photonics article](http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v10/n12/abs/nphoton.2016.217.html), these interacting systems support so-called Fano resonances, an interesting interference effect that I'm continuing to study.


From classical to quantum plasmonics

I've also been interested in understanding how nanoparticle optical properties change as particles decrease in size and quantum effects become significant. At these small sizes, collective electron oscillations, called plasmons, can easily decay into single electron excitations in a process known as Landau damping. Understanding and manipulating this process would facilitate optical manipulation of individual electrons on extremely small length scales.

I've been focused on understanding how environmental changes, from substrates to the presence of other optical emitters, effect this process, and my model agrees with published experiments. I've just submitted a manuscript on this topic.
