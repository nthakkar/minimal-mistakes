I'm a research scientist at the <a href="http://idmod.org">Institute for Disease Modeling</a>, working with the analysis and model usage group in support of measles eradication. I use a variety of machine learning and statistical modeling techniques to understand where better disease surveillance is needed, how best to structure immunization campaigns, and other epidemiology questions. Generally speaking, I'm interested in mathematical modeling and statistics applied to all kinds of problems.

When I'm not doing research, I like to play soccer, motorcycle, read, and (sometimes) travel. Having grown up in Arizona, I'm also always on the look out for good Mexican food. Don't hesitate to email me if you have suggestions (or if you want to talk about math I suppose).
