I'm a PhD candidate in applied mathematics at the University of Washington in Seattle. I work in the <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/masiello/Masiello_Group_Website/Home.html">Masiello group</a>, creating theoretical models of light-matter interaction at the nanoscale and using statistical inference to gain insight from optical and electron-beam based experiments. Generally speaking, I'm interested in mathematical modeling and statistics applied to all kinds of problems.

When I'm not doing research, I like to play soccer, motorcycle, read, and (sometimes) travel. Having grown up in Arizona, I'm also always on the look out for good Mexican food. Don't hesitate to email me if you have suggestions (or if you want to about research I guess). 

**I'm currently looking for a job!** Please contact me if you know of anything or you'd like to talk.
